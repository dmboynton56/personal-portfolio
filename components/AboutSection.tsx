          <p>
            Hey there! I'm a senior at the University of Colorado, set to graduate in May 2025. 
            Originally from Boston, I've found my way to the beautiful Rocky Mountains, where I've 
            been pursuing my passion for web development and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in tech started with simple HTML websites, but I quickly fell in love with 
            the endless possibilities of modern web development. Now, I specialize in creating 
            responsive, user-friendly applications using React and Next.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you might find me hiking in the Flatirons, experimenting with 
            new web technologies, or collaborating with fellow developers on campus. I'm particularly 
            interested in the intersection of design and functionality, always striving to create 
            experiences that are both beautiful and intuitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I approach graduation, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and am always open 
            to connecting with others in the tech community. Whether it's a potential collaboration 
            or just a chat about the latest in web development, I'd love to hear from you.
