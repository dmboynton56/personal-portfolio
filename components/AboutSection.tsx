            Hey, I am Drew Boynton. I have had a passion for almost everything tech
            since I was a kid. I can remember playing video games with my friends and
            then looking up YouTube videos and reading about how the tech world worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            In middle school, I was always on the computer. I would create 3D models for my
            minecraft character and make graphics that, at the time, I thought were pretty cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            In high school, I started to learn how to code. I remember watching a YouTube series
            about creating a game in Unity. Then, I took some start classes in high school, and realized
            that I loved it. You could create anything and everything, and make an impact on the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, I've taken a multitude of classes in college. I've designed and developed a couple
            of websites, and I've worked on a few projects. I've also taken a lot of classes in AI and machine learning.
            I've learned a lot about the tech world, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I approach graduation, I'm excited about the oppurtunities ahead and the future of the tech world. 
            This website showcases some of the projects I've worked on, and some of the things I've learned. My contact
            information is at the bottom of the page, so feel free to reach out to me!
